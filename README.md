# VirtualLaserKeyboard

Hi, thanks for stopping by! 

This is a basic projection keyboard I built last year using OpenCV. The implementation is incredibly hardware specific but nevertheless I thought I would upload the code in case someone stumbles by wanting to make something similar. 

Have a look!
